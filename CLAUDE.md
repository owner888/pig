# pig — pi ported to PHP

A file-by-file port of [earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi): agent core,
unified LLM API, terminal UI, coding agent CLI. Zero runtime dependencies beyond PHP itself.

## Upstream anchor

**Port against commit `d0a4c37` (2026-01-02)** — the snapshot behind the "418 lines" claim
(`packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts` was 417 lines + trailing newline there). Do not port
against upstream HEAD: by 2026-09 that file is 898 lines and `packages/agent/src` is 33k.

Upstream at that commit was still published as `@mariozechner/pi-*`; it is `@earendil-works/pi-*` now.

Reference checkout for diffing lives outside this repo — clone pi and `git checkout d0a4c37`.

## Decisions on record

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Port fidelity | File-by-file literal | Class/file/method names track upstream so `git diff` against a newer upstream commit stays mechanical |
| Concurrency | Hand-written `Fiber` + `stream_select` loop | One `select()` must wait on the LLM socket and STDIN together — that is what makes Esc-to-interrupt and typing mid-stream possible |
| HTTP transport | Raw `tls://` streams, hand-written HTTP/1.1 | Sockets and STDIN are then the same kind of thing; one loop, no `ext-curl` |
| Unions | real union type where the arms are closed and few, marker interface otherwise | PHP has union types; what it lacks is naming one and typing an array's elements — see [Porting the unions](#porting-the-unions) |
| Layout | composer monorepo, `Pig\*` | Mirrors upstream's package split one-to-one |

### Deliberate exceptions to kaka-workflow Rule 4 (prefer platform/standard libs)

Both were chosen explicitly, not by default:

- **TUI is hand-written ANSI + `stty`, not `php-tui/php-tui`** (the Ratatui port, which already
  has differential rendering and widgets). Chosen to port `pi-tui` literally.
- **Event loop is hand-written, not `amphp/amp` v3** (also Fiber-based, with SSE-capable HTTP).
  Chosen to keep the core dependency-free.

`Pig\Async` has no upstream counterpart at all — JS ships an event loop, PHP does not.

## Layout

```
packages/async/  → Pig\Async\       (pig/async)       Loop, Future, Deferred, Async
packages/ai/     → Pig\Ai\          (pig/ai)          unified LLM API
packages/tui/    → Pig\Tui\         (pig/tui)         not started
packages/coding-agent/ → Pig\CodingAgent\              not started
```

Ported so far: `ai/src/utils/event-stream.ts` and all of `ai/src/types.ts`. Next is `ai/src/stream.ts`
and the Anthropic provider, then `agent-core`: `types.ts` 217 → `agent.ts` 439 → `agent-loop.ts` 417.

### Porting the unions

PHP has union types. What it does not have is a way to **name** one or to use one as an array's
element type — `type Message = A|B` and `array<A|B>` are both parse errors. That, not any absence
of unions, is what decides how each of upstream's unions is encoded here:

| Union | Encoding | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Message` (3 arms, closed) | real union type, aliased with `@phpstan-type` on `Context` | closed like upstream, and a `match` over it can be checked for exhaustiveness |
| `AssistantMessageEvent` (12 arms) | marker interface | with no alias, a union means copying twelve class names into every signature |
| `AgentMessage` (apps extend it) | marker interface | a union cannot be extended from outside the package |
| `Content` / `UserContent` / `AssistantContent` | marker interfaces | they are array elements, where the type is a docblock either way — and the interface still holds for a single block passed on its own |

**A marker interface is not exhaustively checkable.** Anything may implement one, so every
`match (true)` over an interface keeps its `default` arm. Only the closed unions get exhaustiveness.
At runtime the two encodings are equally safe: a `match` with no arm taken throws
`UnhandledMatchError` either way.

`UserContent` / `AssistantContent` exist so that "a user message cannot hold thinking" is a type
error rather than a convention. The twelve event classes are named after their wire strings —
`text_delta` → `TextDeltaEvent`; upstream leaves those arms anonymous, so the names are ours.

Deliberate deviations from upstream, both to spare every consumer an unpacking step:
`UserMessage` wraps a bare string into a `TextContent` at construction instead of keeping
`string | Content[]`, and `Context` takes `messages` first because PHP wants required parameters
before optional ones.

## Commands

```bash
composer install        # path repositories + PHPUnit 12
php test/lint.php       # php -l over every file (PHPUnit only parses what it loads)
vendor/bin/phpunit      # filter: vendor/bin/phpunit --filter Loop
```

PHPUnit 12 is the newest release that still runs on PHP 8.3, so it is what the floor allows.
PHPUnit 13 requires 8.4 and becomes available if the floor ever moves.

`test/AssertsThrows.php` adds one assertion on top of PHPUnit: `assertThrows()` asserts a throw
mid-test and hands back the exception, which `expectException()` cannot do because it scopes to
the whole method.

The dev container has no route to packagist, so tests run on the Mac, not in the agent sandbox.

## Known traps

### `stream_socket_enable_crypto()` returns `0`, not just `true`/`false`

On a non-blocking socket the TLS handshake needs several passes. `0` means "call me again after
the socket is readable"; treating it as failure breaks the connection intermittently — measured
2 passes against `api.anthropic.com`.

```php
while (true) {
    $ok = stream_socket_enable_crypto($sock, true, STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_CLIENT);
    if ($ok === true) break;
    if ($ok === false) throw new TransportError('TLS handshake failed');
    $r = [$sock]; $w = $e = null; stream_select($r, $w, $e, $timeout);  // $ok === 0
}
```

### A signal makes `stream_select()` return `false`

Terminal resize sends SIGWINCH. With a handler installed, an in-flight `stream_select()` is
interrupted and returns `false` with errno 4 — reproduced with `pcntl_fork` + `posix_kill`, and
the whole agent dies on the next resize. EINTR is not a failure: the handler already ran, so
return and let the next tick re-arm. Match the errno, not the message text, which is localized.

```php
error_clear_last();                        // so error_get_last() cannot report a stale warning
$ready = @stream_select($read, $write, $except, $seconds, $microseconds);

if ($ready === false) {
    $message = error_get_last()['message'] ?? 'unknown error';
    if (str_contains($message, 'Unable to select [4]')) return;   // EINTR
    throw new AsyncError("stream_select() failed: {$message}");
}
```

Regression test: `LoopTest::testASignalDuringSelectDoesNotKillTheLoop`.

### Closing a stream without cancelling its watcher

`stream_select()` silently drops closed streams from the array, then fails with
`ValueError: No stream arrays were passed` — which names nothing useful. `Loop::poll()` checks
`is_resource()` per watcher and throws naming the watcher id instead. On EOF: `cancel()` first,
then `fclose()`.

### Resuming a Fiber that has not suspended yet

`$fiber->resume()` on a running fiber throws `FiberError: Cannot resume a fiber that is not
suspended`. So `FutureState` never invokes callbacks synchronously — every one goes through
`Loop::defer()`, which also keeps completion callbacks out of the completer's own stack.

### `stream_socket_pair()` with a dropped peer (tests)

`[$a] = stream_socket_pair(...)` garbage-collects the peer, putting `$a` at EOF — permanently
"readable", with `fread()` returning `''`. Keep both ends in scope.

## Version floor: PHP >= 8.3

`Fiber` arrived in 8.1 and the whole async runtime rests on it, so 8.1 is the absolute floor;
8.3 is the floor actually declared, because 8.1 is end-of-life and 8.2 loses security support at
the end of 2026. `require.php` in the three composer.json files is the source of truth.

Off-limits until the floor moves, even though the dev machine runs 8.4:

| Feature | Since |
|---|---|
| Property hooks, asymmetric visibility (`public private(set)`) | 8.4 |
| `new Foo()->bar()` without parentheses | 8.4 |
| `array_find` / `array_find_key` / `array_any` / `array_all` | 8.4 |

Where 8.4 would express something better, say so in a comment rather than leaving it unexplained —
`FutureState` reads that way, since on 8.4 its readers would collapse into `public private(set)`.

Verify against the floor, not just the dev version: `for f in $(find packages test -name '*.php');
do php8.3 -l $f; done`. 8.3 rejects both 8.4-only constructs above at parse time.

## Conventions

- `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` are one document in two languages. Every change to one lands
  in the other in the same commit — a half-translated README is worse than an untranslated one.
- `declare(strict_types=1)` in every file; PSR-12; one class per file.
- `match` over `switch`, `#[\Override]` on every override, `str_contains`/`str_starts_with`,
  constructor property promotion, `readonly` for anything that should not change after construction.
- No `@` error suppression. A function that warns *and* returns false gets a `set_error_handler`
  around it, because the warning text is usually the only place the errno appears.
- No silent fallback: `catch` must re-throw (`throw new X(..., $e)`). No `?? default` to paper
  over a missing value, no `clamp`/floor without a reproduced bug behind it.
- `Deferred::complete()` twice throws. Where ported code relies on a JS promise ignoring its
  second resolve, the call site guards with `isComplete()` and says so in a comment — so the
  leniency stays local instead of becoming a global rule.
