# Design: PHP and the async runtime

Fiber, Loop, Future, sockets, and where PHP is not JavaScript. Moved out of `AGENTS.md` (then `CLAUDE.md`) as written — "this file" in the entries below means that file, where they were first written. The index is generated from the headings below.

## Porting the unions

PHP has union types. What it does not have is a way to **name** one or to use one as an array's
element type — `type Message = A|B` and `array<A|B>` are both parse errors. That, not any absence
of unions, is what decides how each of upstream's unions is encoded here:

| Union | Encoding | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Message` (3 arms, closed) | real union type, aliased with `@phpstan-type` on `Context` | closed like upstream, and a `match` over it can be checked for exhaustiveness |
| `AssistantMessageEvent` (12 arms) | marker interface | with no alias, a union means copying twelve class names into every signature |
| `AgentMessage` (apps extend it) | marker interface | a union cannot be extended from outside the package |
| `Content` / `UserContent` / `AssistantContent` | marker interfaces | they are array elements, where the type is a docblock either way — and the interface still holds for a single block passed on its own |

**A marker interface is not exhaustively checkable.** Anything may implement one, so every
`match (true)` over an interface keeps its `default` arm. Only the closed unions get exhaustiveness.
At runtime the two encodings are equally safe: a `match` with no arm taken throws
`UnhandledMatchError` either way.

`UserContent` / `AssistantContent` exist so that "a user message cannot hold thinking" is a type
error rather than a convention. The twelve event classes are named after their wire strings —
`text_delta` → `TextDeltaEvent`; upstream leaves those arms anonymous, so the names are ours.

Deliberate deviations from upstream, both to spare every consumer an unpacking step:
`UserMessage` wraps a bare string into a `TextContent` at construction instead of keeping
`string | Content[]`, and `Context` takes `messages` first because PHP wants required parameters
before optional ones.
